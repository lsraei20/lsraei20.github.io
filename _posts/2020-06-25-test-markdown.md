I hear you screaming from thousands of miles away **'TEXAS!'**. I get it, I thought the same too. Who can blame us? Texas is the meme state of cheap real estate so what better place to start with right? Well... I'll let the data talk by itself.


## Growth 

You always hear the same cliche saying from stock trading, 'Buy Low, Sell High' (I wish it was that easy). So why shouldn't we use the same principle when it comes to real estate? Except of course for the selling part, how are you gonna build your wealth if you keep giving it away? this is a long term dream, not a get rich quick penny stock. However, the 'buy low' part of the saying is valid, really really valid! If you're going to invest your hard-earned money on a property, you want it to grow so this is the first principle we will be analyzing. We want to find states where growth is in the table, not state where growth **was** on the table. In order to accomplish this we'll be looking at 3 different characteristics of each state, starting with:

## Population Growth 

It is a simple supply and demand game, nothing more, nothing less. If you have people fleeing you state chances are there are fewer people to buy already existing properties causing them to decrease their prices. If instead, you have growing demand and a growing need of housing, the price of properties will rise and include a premium, at the end of the day you are the one that needs a roof and another thousand people are competing to get that same roof over their head. I manage to scrape some data from the United States Census Bureau and made a comprehensive, easy to read heat map to give you a better idea of which states are getting the biggest population percentage increases. This heat map shows the **average** yearly increase population percentage from 2017 to 2019 (**NOT THE ACTUAL PERCENTAGE POPULATION INCREASE FROM 2017 TO 2019**).

Idaho?! Since when is Idaho so cool? Texas is falling behind. And Alaska is just getting rid of people, the same as throwing your money straight to fire... 
Moving on we have another characteristic which should hopefully follow closely with population increase, and that's of course:

## Job Growth

A growing economy is crucial for our investment to make sense, I considered taking the GDP into account instead of job growth but it is just not the same. This chart is for the average joe, not a millionaire or large corporations, and sadly GDP can be troublesome when it comes to taking its majority of the population into account. On the other hand, job growth does make a difference in people's lives. Not only are there more positions available to accommodate most of the residents, but it also gives people the chance to grow their career and salary. This would make it possible for more and more families to start buying property for their own which would be great for the real estate market (meaning it would keep growing and with it all of **your** properties. This next heat map is similar to the last one, it shows the **average** yearly increase in job growth from 2017 to 2019.

Just as we predicted, job growth follows closely to population increase although not perfectly matched, we'll go more into detail later on. Now, we will be looking at our last characteristic, which results to be the center of this whole article, the main dish of our investing hunger which is of course:

## Real Estate Growth

There is nothing wrong with looking at the past to make decisions. Having said that, it just isn't bright to make it the only thing we take into consideration. Cause and effect on the market often do not take an immediate 1 to 1, it takes time. It is important to take history into account and observe what patterns have made the market go up or down. You know the drill...  Next up we'll be looking and the **average** yearly increase in the history of the market from 2017 to 2019.

Idaho seems to be going on a limp there! They have been keeping the secret from us, how rude is that?!

## Scoring System

Naturally, this might be a lot of information to take in immediately. I decided to make a scoring system to take all of them into consideration and condense the information into a dopamine inducing graph which goes straight to the point. Let me explain, each characteristic we went through (Real Estate growth, Job growth, and Population growth) can be worth up to 1 point for the best or 0 for the worst state. In the end, all the points will be added and show, ready?

I do want to clarify that this information was taken from points in time before Covid-19. There is no way for anyone to know that the long term effects of this pandemic will look like, only time will tell.
